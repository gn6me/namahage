A 2 player strategy card game

# Rules

##Object of the Game
Namahage is a game for 2 players. Both players play and draw from a shared deck of cards. Each player takes turns placing 1 card onto an empty cell on their field of a 3x3 grid. Each card has a value that contributes to the player’s points total. Play continues until one player reaches a total of 21 points or higher and then the player with the most points wins.

##Starting the Game
Deal both players 10 cards each. This is their starting hand. To determine who goes first, both players may roll a die. Once player order is determined both players may begin their mulligan, starting with the 2nd player.

##Mulliganing
Starting with the player going 2nd, players may choose to put up to 5 of their cards back into the deck. The player going 1st then does the same. Once both players have put their chosen cards back into the deck, shuffle the deck, and then deal cards to each player until both have 10.

After mulligan is complete players then 1st player starts their turn.

##Gameplay
During their turn, each player chooses 1 card from their hand and places it onto an empty cell on their field. Then that player resolves any On-Play effects of that card, tallies up their current total points, and then passes the turn. Play continues this way until the game ends.

##Winning the Game
The game ends when both players run out of cards to play or once any player reaches a total of 21 points or higher after all card effects have resolved. Then the total points of each player are tallied up and the one with the most, wins.

#Resolving Card Effects

##On Play
Any cards with an On Play effect happen as soon as you play the card from hand. Generally, On Play effects only happen when you play a card from hand, unless another card says otherwise.

##Ongoing
Any cards with an Ongoing effect are continuous effects
